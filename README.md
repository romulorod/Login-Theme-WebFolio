# Login-Theme-WebFolio

Welcome to my WebFolio!

This is to show some of my skills at HTML5, CSS3 and JS ES6+.

The first page you will access will show some HTML and CSS skills, as @keyframes and Flexbox, also 100% fully responsive.

As soon as you click on the "second" Sign In button, after the first animation, you'll be redirected to a game, the Even/Odd Game which you will play against the code. There you must select Even, Odd or Random and set a number from 0 to 5, simulating your own hand, the code will generate a random number also the code will select the opposite of your choice between Even or Odd. The result will be the sum of both your numbers, and if the result matches your selection between Even or Odd then you have won the game, either way you lose. The results are inserted via DOM Manipulation through JavaScript. At the bottom of the result card will be shwon a link to my resume. I hope you enjoys this experience, thank you so much!
